# SSCU-Net
Shallow Super Convolution U-shaped Net

# Model Description
The analysis and intelligent processing of medical images heavily rely on semantic segmentation techniques. Despite the trend towards larger and deeper network models driven by advancements in deep learning and hardware, there's a limited emphasis on creating compact and efficient networks. While Transformers have gained attention for their exceptional performance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) still possess untapped potential.

In response to this, we propose a unique approach with the Shallow Super Convolution U-shaped Net (SSCU-Net), a shallow-depth fully convolutional U-shaped variant network. Embracing a specialized fusion philosophy, this network employs various convolution modules in parallel to explore the depths of convolutional neural networks, aiming to enhance performance in image semantic segmentation tasks. To further optimize the model, we introduce specialized modules like the Super Convolution Block (SC-Block) and the Spatial Convolution Path (SC-Path).
